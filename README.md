====================

# Overview

This repo is an extracted version of how we run PostgreSQL clusters.

It helps you quickly spin up a 2-node cluster of PostgreSQL, managed by Pacemaker and corosync, and proxied by PgBouncer.

It's intended as a playground for us, and a learning resource that we wanted to share with the community.

You can hear more about how the cluster works in our talk - [Zero-downtime Postgres upgrades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAkNBiZzEX8).

# What's in the cluster?

When you start the cluster, you get 2 nodes, each running:

  - PostgreSQL
  - Pacemaker and corosync
  - PgBouncer

All packages are from Ubuntu 16.04, except for PostgreSQL itself, which is at version 9.6.

The cluster is configured with a single primary and one asynchronous replica.

# Dependencies
1. [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
3. `git clone https://github.com/vtomasr5/our-postgresql-setup.git`
4. [Recommended] [tmux](https://tmux.github.io) (Windows not supported)

# Getting started

## With tmux 
1.  `./tmux-session.sh start`

## By hand
1.  On 2 separate windows:
2.  `vagrant up pg01 && vagrant ssh pg01`
3.  wait 10 seconds before start pg02
4.  `vagrant up pg02 && vagrant ssh pg02`

# Viewing cluster status

You can run `sudo crm_mon -Afr` on any node to see the current state of the cluster and all resources in it. Press `^c` to quit.

Commands for playing with the cluster:
1. Force a failover in pg01 node: `sudo crm node standby pg01` (or pg02)
2. Cleanup corosync messages: `sudo crm resource cleanup Postgresql`
3. Return a node back online: `sudo crm node online pg01` (perhaps you may need to start the postgresql manually)

# Connecting to PostgreSQL

Once the cluster is up, you have two options:

  - Connect directly to Postgres on the PostgresqlVIP at 172.28.33.10
  - Connect via PgBouncer at 172.28.33.9

*Note*: The migrator.py script will only give you zero-downtime migrations if you connect via PgBouncer.

# Running a zero-downtime migration

1. Ensure clients are connected to the PgBouncerVIP.
2. Run `/vagrant/migrator.py` on the node that has the PgBouncerVIP (you can find out where the PgBouncerVIP is by viewing the cluster status).
3. Follow the prompts.
    1. It is safe to ignore the `Make sure you have the following command ready...` prompt. This is aimed at cases where you'd want to quickly re-enable traffic, and doesn't matter when running locally.
4. Assuming everything went well, the primary will migrate to the synchronous replica, and the clients won't have received any connection resets.

# TODO

- [x] Upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- [x] Test on a Windows host (tested on Linux and macOS hosts)
- [ ] Add repmgr support
- [ ] Improve documentation

# I have a question!

We're happy to receive questions as issues on this repo, so don't be shy!

It's hard to know exactly what documentation/guidance is useful to people, so we'll use the questions we answer to improve this README and link out to more places you can read up on the technologies we're using.
